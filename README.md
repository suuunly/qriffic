# Qriffic
This is an open-source QR Code app
No payment required, no login required and no subscription limitations.

## What is the goal of this project?
To keep QR code generation free and hassle free.
It is 2025, why do we still have feature limits/restrictions on products as essential as QR code generation? No more!
